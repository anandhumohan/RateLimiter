# RateLimiter for Spring Boot

## Overview

This project provides a RateLimiter implementation for Spring Boot applications, designed to prevent excessive use of resources by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a certain period. It's ideal for APIs and web applications where controlling traffic is essential to maintain service quality and prevent abuse.

## Features

- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily configure rate limits based on IP, user ID, or endpoints.
- **Annotation-based Integration**: Quickly integrate with Spring Boot applications using custom annotations.
- **Scalable and Extendable**: Designed to support different storage backends (in-memory, Redis, etc.) for scalability.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Offers insights into current request rates and limits through endpoints or metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Spring Boot 2.3.0 or higher

### Adding the RateLimiter to Your Project

You can include the RateLimiter in your Spring Boot project by adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yourcompany</groupId>
    <artifactId>ratelimiter-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Configuration

Configure the rate limits in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```yaml
ratelimiter:
  enabled: true
  policies:
    - limit: 100
      period: 1h
      type: IP
    - limit: 1000
      period: 1d
      type: USER
```

### Usage

Annotate your Spring Boot controller methods with `@RateLimit` to apply rate limiting:

A good `README` for a RateLimiter project built on Spring Boot should provide a comprehensive overview of the project, including its purpose, how to set up and configure it, examples of usage, and any other relevant information. Below is a template you can use and adapt for your GitHub project:

```

### Usage

Annotate your Spring Boot controller methods with `@RateLimit` to apply rate limiting:

```java
@RestController
public class YourController {

    @GetMapping("/your-endpoint")
    @RateLimit(limit = 100, period = "1h")
    public ResponseEntity<String> yourMethod() {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Response");
    }
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Storage Backend

By default, the RateLimiter uses an in-memory storage. To use a different storage backend, implement the `RateLimiterStorage` interface and configure it as a Spring Bean.

### Monitoring and Metrics

Enable real-time monitoring of rate limits by accessing the `/ratelimiter-status` endpoint, or integrate with Spring Actuator for detailed metrics.
